> 19\. **What means “rate of change of angular momentum” for a SYSTEM of particles?** You should master problem 14 before looking at this problem. Consider a system of moving particles with moving center of mass at G. Consider also a moving point C (moving relative to a Newtonian frame $\mathcal{F}$ that has an origin 0). For which of these definitions of $\vec{H}_{/C}$ Is the following equation of motion true (that is, consistent with $\vec{F} = m\vec{a}$)?

> (a) $\vec{H}_{/C} = \sum \vec{r}_{i/C'} \times \vec{v}_{i/C'}$, where C' is a point fixed in $\mathcal{F}$ that instantaneously coincides with C. (Hint: this definition is good one, always!)
> (b) $\vec{H}_{/C} = \sum \vec{r}_{i/C} \times \vec{v}_{i/0} m_i$. (This strange definition is used in the classic, but in this case odd, Dynamics book by Housner and Hudson.)
> (c) $\vec{H}_{/C} = \sum \vec{r}_{i/C} \times \vec{v}_{i/C} m_i$. (Hint: this is the most important candidate definition, but it's only good for special kinds of C, namely: C = COM, C is fixed and ...?)

> That is, for each possible definition of $\vec{H}/C$ you need to calculate $\dot{\vec{H}}_{/C}$ by differentiation and see if and when you get $\sum \vec{r}_{i/C} \times \vec{a}_{i/0} mi$. If you are short for time just consider cases (a) and (c) and note their agreement if C is stationary or if C=G. Students in 5730 are expected to do a competent clear job of all three parts.
