> What means “rate of change of angular momentum”? Consider a moving particle P. Consider also a moving point C (moving relative to a Newtonian frame $\mathcal{F}$ that has an origin 0). For which of these definitions of $\vec{H}_{/C}$ Is the following equation of motion true (that is, consistent with $\vec{F} = m \cdot \vec{a}$)?
> $$\vec{M}_C = \dot{\vec{H}}_{/C}$$
> 
> In each case say whether the definition works i) in general, or ii) for some special cases (that you name) concerning the motions of P and C.
>
> (a) $\vec{H}_{/C} = \vec{r}_{P/C'} \times \vec{v}_{P/0} m$, where C' is a point fixed in $\mathcal{F}$ that instantaneuosly coincides with C.
> (b) $\vec{H}_{/C} = \vec{r}_{P/C} \times \vec{v}_{P/0} m$.
> (c) $\vec{H}_{/C} = \vec{r}_{P/C} \times \vec{v}_{P/C} m$.

> That is, for each possible definition of $\vec{H}_{/C}$ you need to calculate $\dot{\vec{H}}_{C}$ by differentiation and see if and when you get $\dot{\vec{H}}_{/C} = \vec{r}_{P/C} \times m \vec{a}_{P/\mathcal{F}}$
