# 17\. **Montgomery’s eight.**

(From Ruina/Pratap). Three equal masses, say $m = 1$, are attracted by an inverse-square gravity law with $G = 1$. That is, each mass is attracted to the other by $F = G m_1 m_2 / r^2$ where $r$ is the distance between them. Use these unusual and special initial positions:

$$
\begin{align*}
(x1, y1) &= (−0.97000436, 0.24308753) \\
(x2, y2) &= (−x1, −y1) \\
(x3, y3) &= (0, 0)
\end{align*}
$$

and initial velocities

$$
\begin{align*}
(vx3, vy3) &= (0.93240737, 0.86473146) \\
(vx1, vy1) &= −(vx3, vy3)/2 \\
(vx2, vy2) &= −(vx3, vy3)/2. \\
\end{align*}
$$

For each of the problems below show accurate computer plots and explain any curiosities.

(a) Use computer integration to find and plot the motions of the particles. Plot each with a different color. Run the program for 2.1 time units.
(b) Same as above, but run for 10 time units.
(c) Same as above, but change the initial conditions slightly.
(d) Same as above, but change the initial conditions more and run for a much longer time.
