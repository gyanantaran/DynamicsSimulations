> 20\. **Two masses.** This problem has 3 independent educational goals:
>
> (a) Motivate the use of kinematic constraints.
> (b) Introduce the simplest of a class of vibrations problems which you should master. At this point, it is this aspect: mastery of derivation of the equations of motion. You should check that you can reproduce the lecture example with no sign errors without looking up anything.
> (c) Development of critical exploration using analytical and numerical methods.

> Two masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ are constrained to move frictionlessly on the x axis. Initially they are stationary at positions $x_1(0) = 0$ and $x_2(0) = \ell_0$. They are connected with a linear spring with constant k and rest length $\ell_0$. A rightwards force is applied to the second mass. It is a step, or '[Heaviside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function]' function

> (a) Write code to calculate, plot and (optionally) animate the motions for arbitrary values of the given constants.
> (b) Within numerical precision, should your numerical solution always have the property that $F = (m_1 + m_2) a_G$ where $x_G = (x_1 m_1 + x_2 m_2)/(m_1 + m_2)$? (As always in this course, "yes and no" questions aare not multiple choice, but need justification that another sutdent, one who got the opposite answer as you, would find convincing.)
> (c) Use you numerics to demonstrate that if $k$ is large the motion (displacement relative to its starting postion) of *each* mass is, for time scales large compared to the oscillations, close to the cneter of mass motion.
> (d) 5730 only: Using analytical arguments, perhaps inspired by and buttressed with numerical examples, make the following statement as precise as possible:

> Of course, in detail, the system has 2 degrees of freedom (DOF). So you are looking for a way to measure the extent to which the system acts like it has 1 DOF, and in which conditions (for which extreme values of parameters and times) the system is close to 1 DOF by that measure. There is not a simple single unique answer to this question.
