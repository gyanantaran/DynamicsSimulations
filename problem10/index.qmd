# a. Plot 2D projection of 3D trajectories

In file [./SpringPendulum3D/src/Physics.jl](./SpringPendulum3D/src/Physics.jl)

```julia
function spring_pendulum3d!(du, u, p::Parameters.Param, t)
    @unpack mass, gravity, stiffness, restinglen#=, viscosity=# = p

    r⃗ = u[1:3]
    v⃗ = u[4:6]

    k = [0.0; 0.0; 1.0]
    gravity = mass * gravity * (-k)
    spring = stiffness * (norm(r⃗) - restinglen) * (-normalize(r⃗))
    # drag = -viscosity * v⃗

    force = (spring #=+ drag =#+ gravity)

    du[1:3] = v⃗
    du[4:6] = force / mass
end
```

The 3D trajectories look like ellipses. For a particular set of parameters, given in the following

![../media/problem10/trajectory_plot.png](../media/problem10/trajectory_plot.png)

```julia
# ...

# problem setup
x₀, y₀, z₀ = (1, 0, 0)
r₀ = [x₀; y₀; z₀]
v₀ = [0.0; 1.0; 0.0]
u₀ = [r₀; v₀]
tspan = (0.0, 10.0)
p = Parameters.Param(m = 1, g = 1, k = 2, l₀ = 0)
prob = ODEProblem(Physics.spring_pendulum3d!, u₀, tspan, p)

# ...
```

The 2D projection onto the xy, yz, zx respectively, are as follows:

# b. Play around with initial conditions, and find the most wild motions

I was not able to find any wild motions, other than numerical errors.

# c. Analytically justify answer to part (b)

If we look at the differential equations, it is equivalent to having three independent springs in the three mutually orthogonal directions with a constant shift in the 'z-spring' due to gravity.
